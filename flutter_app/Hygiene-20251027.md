Hygiene changes (2025-10-27)

Summary
- Replaced deprecated Color.withOpacity usages with Color.withValues(alpha: ...).
- Migrated ThemeData.cardTheme to use CardThemeData where necessary.
- Replaced `print(...)` with `debugPrint(...)` in core services and added required imports.
- Replaced deprecated `SwitchListTile.activeColor` with `activeThumbColor`.
- Added Flutter/Dart ignores to .gitignore to avoid committing build artifacts.

Verification
- `flutter analyze` run in `flutter_app` — No issues found.
- `flutter build web --release` completed successfully and produced `build/web`.

Notes / Follow-ups
- Consider migrating logging to a structured logger (e.g. `package:logger`) in a follow-up.
- Several packages have newer versions available; perform controlled upgrades and test.
- If WebAssembly is a target, address packages flagged by the Wasm dry-run (they import `dart:html` / `package:js`).

Files changed (high level)
- lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart — color API and CardThemeData updates
- lib/core/widgets/* — migrated color opacity usages
- lib/screens/* — migrated color opacity usages, minor lint fixes
- lib/core/services/* — debugPrint replacements

How to reproduce verification

2. flutter pub get
3. flutter analyze
4. flutter build web --release
