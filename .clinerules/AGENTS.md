# Archon Integration & Workflow

**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.**

## Core Archon Workflow Principles

### The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Development with Archon

**Archon Project**
**Project Name** CultivAR 
**ID =**118a6a9c-20d4-42c3-a174-32fc37d474ea

**MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon task cycle before any coding:**
**Use archon MCP to perform the followin**
1. **Check for Archon project exsist** → Review [Project] see is Project for our current [Workspace] if there is no [Project] make one named after[Workspace]
2. **Check for any backlock Task** → Review [Project] see is there are any backlog [task] for the current [Project]
3. **Check Current Task** → Review task details and requirements
4. **Research for Task** → Search relevant documentation and examples
5. **Implement the Task** → Write code based on research
6. **Update Task Status** → Move task from "todo" → "doing" → "review"
7. **Get Next Task** → Check for next priority task
8. **Repeat Cycle**

**Task Management Rules:**
- Update all actions to Archon
- Move tasks from "todo" → "doing" → "review" (not directly to complete)
- Maintain task descriptions and add implementation notes
- DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - check project documentation for questions
