# CultivAR Security Audit Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a security audit of the CultivAR application. The audit covered a review of the application's source code, API endpoints, and overall logic flow.

The audit revealed several security vulnerabilities, ranging from low to critical severity. The most critical issues are a destructive database migration function and a lack of input validation, which could expose the application to a wide range of attacks. Other significant issues include inconsistent authorization checks, information disclosure through unauthenticated endpoints, and insecure file uploads.

This report provides detailed findings and recommendations for addressing these issues. Prioritizing these recommendations will significantly improve the security and reliability of the CultivAR application.

## 2. Vulnerability Findings

### 2.1. Critical Vulnerabilities

*   **Destructive Database Migration:**
    *   **Description:** The `migrate_db` function in `app/models/__init__.py` uses `db.drop_all()`, which deletes all data in the database. This is extremely dangerous and should never be used in a production environment.
    *   **Recommendation:** Replace the current migration function with a proper database migration tool like Alembic.

### 2.2. High Severity Vulnerabilities

*   **Lack of Input Validation:**
    *   **Description:** The application lacks proper input validation in many of its handlers. This could allow attackers to inject malicious data, leading to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement robust input validation in all application handlers to ensure that user-supplied data is of the expected type and format.
*   **Insecure File Uploads:**
    *   **Description:** The file upload functionalities for logos and decorated images do not validate file size or type. This could allow an attacker to upload large files, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, or to upload malicious files.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement file size and type validation for all file uploads.
*   **`NameError` in `sensor_handlers.py`:**
    *   **Description:** The `requests` import is commented out in `app/handlers/sensor_handlers.py`, which will cause a `NameError` when the `scan_ac_infinity_sensors` function is called.
    *   **Recommendation:** Uncomment the `import requests` line.

### 2.3. Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

*   **Inconsistent Admin Authorization:**
    *   **Description:** The application uses two different methods for checking for admin privileges: `session.get('admin')` and `current_user.is_admin`. This inconsistency can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.
    *   **Recommendation:** Standardize on using `current_user.is_admin` for all admin checks.
*   **Information Disclosure via Diagnostics Endpoint:**
    *   **Description:** The `/diagnostics` endpoint is unauthenticated and exposes sensitive information about the application and the server environment.
    *   **Recommendation:** Require admin authentication for this endpoint.
*   **Unprotected Admin API Endpoint:**
    *   **Description:** The `/api/admin/diagnostics/test` endpoint is not protected by the `admin_required` decorator.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add the `@admin_required` decorator to this endpoint.
*   **Inconsistent Error Handling:**
    *   **Description:** The error handling is inconsistent across the application. Some functions return detailed error messages, while others return generic messages or just log the error.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a consistent error handling strategy that returns generic error messages to the user and logs detailed error messages for debugging.

### 2.4. Low Severity Vulnerabilities

*   **User Enumeration:**
    *   **Description:** The login and signup forms provide different error messages for "user not found" and "invalid password", which could allow an attacker to enumerate valid usernames.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a generic error message like "Invalid username or password" for both cases.
*   **Lack of Password Complexity Rules:**
    *   **Description:** The application does not enforce any password complexity rules.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement password complexity rules to ensure that users create strong passwords.
*   **Extensive Logging in Login Route:**
    *   **Description:** The `/login` route has extensive logging and debugging print statements that could leak information in a production environment.
    *   **Recommendation:** Remove the debugging print statements.
*   **Unused/Incompatible Code:**
    *   **Description:** The `check_password` function in `app/utils/auth.py` is unused and incompatible with the password hashing scheme used in the application.
    *   **Recommendation:** Remove the `check_password` function from `app/utils/auth.py`.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Immediately address the critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.** This includes replacing the destructive database migration, implementing input validation, securing file uploads, and fixing the `NameError` in `sensor_handlers.py`.
2.  **Standardize the authorization checks** to use `current_user.is_admin`.
3.  **Secure the diagnostics endpoints** by requiring admin authentication.
4.  **Implement a consistent error handling strategy** that provides generic error messages to the user.
5.  **Address the low-severity vulnerabilities** to further improve the security posture of the application.
