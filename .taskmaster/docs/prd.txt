# CultivAR - Cannabis Grow platform.

## Project Overview
CultivAR is a comprehensive cannabis cultivation management platform built with Python Flask and FastAPI. It provides growers with tools to track plants, manage cultivars, monitor environmental conditions, and maintain detailed grow journals.

## Core Features

### Plant Management
- Track plant lifecycle from seedling to harvest
- Monitor growth stages and development progress
- Record plant measurements and observations
- Manage multiple grow rooms and environments

### Cultivar Database
- Maintain comprehensive strain library
- Track genetics and breeding information
- Store detailed cultivar characteristics
- Support for custom strain creation

### Environmental Monitoring
- Integration with environmental sensors (AC Infinity, Ecowitt)
- Real-time temperature, humidity, and CO2 monitoring
- Automated data collection and visualization
- Historical environmental data analysis

### User Management
- Multi-user support with role-based access
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Admin dashboard for user management
- Activity logging and audit trails

### Blog and Marketing
- Built-in blogging platform
- Marketing site integration
- Newsletter subscription system
- Social media sharing capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Technologies
- **Flask**: Primary web framework for core application
- **FastAPI**: REST API for modern frontend integration
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database management
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Database support
- **Redis**: Session management and caching

### Frontend Technologies
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive UI framework
- **JavaScript**: Interactive client-side functionality
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization
- **CKEditor**: Rich text editing

### Integration Points
- Environmental sensor APIs (AC Infinity, Ecowitt)
- Social media platforms
- Email service integration
- File upload and image management

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
- Blueprint-based Flask architecture
- Separation of concerns with handlers, models, and routes
- Async/await support for I/O operations
